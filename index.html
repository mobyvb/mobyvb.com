      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I'm Maximillian Mohammed von Briesen</p>
      <p>also known as Moby</p>
      <p>I'm an aspiring web developer and programmer in Charlotte, North Carolina. I'm going to Georgia Tech in the fall to study Computer Science. I love slacklining, urban gymnastics, video games, all types of music (from house to hip hop), sleep, and general survival.</p>
      <p>I'm not yet sure what I want to do with my life. I'm torn between pursuing web development and getting involved with robots. The one thing I know for sure is that I'd like to travel the world.</p>

      <h2>Web development</h2>
      <p>I absolutely love web development. I currently work as a developer for Skookum Digital Works, a company headquartered in Charlotte. Creating functional applications from nothing but text is fascinating, so that's what I do.</p>
      <p>This is where I inform you that I am fluent with Javascript, Node, Ruby, Rails, PHP, SQL, MongoDB HTML5, CSS3, Jade, React, and a couple dozen other things.</p>
      <p>It's an attempt to impress people who have no idea what I'm talking about, but really all it does is make people who do know what I'm talking about roll their eyes. Feel free to judge my web development skills based on the list of buzzwords above. However, I'd rather you judge them based on my projects:</p>

      <h2>Other stuff</h2>
      <p>I try to do cool stuff apart from web development. I was the lead programmer of FRC team 3506 for three years. In addition, I've done a couple personal robotics projects:</p>
