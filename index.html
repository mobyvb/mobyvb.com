      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I'm Maximillian Mohammed von Briesen</p>
      <p>also known as Moby</p>
      <p>I'm an aspiring web developer and programmer in Atlanta, Georgia. I'm currently attending Georgia Tech as a Computer Science major. I love slacklining, urban gymnastics, video games, all types of music (from house to hip hop), sleep, and general survival.</p>
      <p>I'm not yet sure what I want to do with my life. I'm torn between pursuing web development and getting involved with robots. The one thing I know for sure is that I'd like to travel the world.</p>

      <h2>Web development</h2>
      <p>I absolutely love web development. Before coming to Georgia Tech, I worked as a developer for Skookum Digital Works, a company headquartered in Charlotte, NC. Creating functional applications from nothing but text is fascinating, so that's what I do.</p>
      <p>This is where I inform you that I am fluent with Javascript, Node, Ruby, Rails, PHP, SQL, MongoDB HTML5, CSS3, Jade, React, and several other things.</p>
      <p>It's an attempt to impress people who have no idea what I'm talking about, but really all it does is make people who do know what I'm talking about roll their eyes. Feel free to judge my web development skills based on the list of buzzwords above. However, I'd rather you judge them based on my projects:</p>

            <p>This is a frontend app that can upload, play, and downlaod MIDI files from the browser. It is a work in progress, the next step being to allow editing. It is a small part of a much bigger app I want to work on.</p>

            <h1>Bot Wars</h1>
            <p>This was a web app I built working at Skookum. It was intended as a challenge for developers at Skookum, but the tournament included people from outside the company.</p>
            <p>Each participant builds a web server for their bot. During a game, each bot receives a game state and responds with its moves for every turn until one bot is victorious. More detailed rules can be found in the Github repository.</p>

          <div class='more-info'>
            <h1>Story Game</h1>
            <p>This is a webapp I built based on a game I was very fond of in my freshman year of high school.</p>
            <p>The game is played on a piece of paper. Each player reads the previous sentence of a story, and continues the story on the next line. When he/she is done, he/she folds the paper over so only the sentence just written can be read by the next player.</p>

          <div class='more-info'>
            <h1>Download Simulator 2013</h1>
            <p>The Ludum Dare is a 48-hour game development competition. This was my first ever Ludum Dare game. I built it between August 23rd and August 25th of 2013. Unfortunately, the first day of school was on the 26th of August.</p>
            <p>The theme for the 27th Ludum Dare was "10 Seconds." You have to beat each level in my game in under 10 seconds.</p>

            <h1>Forgotten Child</h1>
            <p>This was my second Ludum Dare game. I built it between December 13th and December 15th of 2013.  Like my first LD game, it was rather bizarre. I don't plan on changing that for future competitions.</p>
            <p>The theme for the 28th Ludum Dare was "you only get one." In my game, you only have one minute to win.</p>

            <p>This was the third Ludum Dare I participated in. I built it as part of a team between August 22nd and August 25th of 2014. I worked with Raphael Gontijo Lopes, Aniruddha Nadkarni, and Altan Stalker, fellow freshmen at GT.</p>
            <p>The theme for the 30th Ludum Dare was "connected worlds." In this game, the goal is to make connections between planets to colonize them, and to fight against opposing planets to stop the computer from doing the same.</p>

      <h2>Other stuff</h2>
      <p>I try to do cool stuff apart from web development. I was the lead programmer of FRC team 3506 for three years. In addition, I've done a couple personal robotics projects:</p>
